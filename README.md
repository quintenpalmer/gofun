GoFun
=====
A project written in go to demonstrate git and go proficiency

Run
---
You need to export the GOPATH:

	export GOPATH=`pwd`

To build the project to a binary that you can keep running:

	go build main.go
	./main

To just have go build and run the project

	go run main.go

To save yourself having to run two commands you can run:

	GOPATH=`pwd` go run main.go

YayOneliners!
